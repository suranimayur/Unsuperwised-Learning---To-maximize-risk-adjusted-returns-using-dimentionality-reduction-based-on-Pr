#  Problem Definition

Our goal in this case study is to maximize risk-adjusted returns using dimensionality
reduction-based algorithm on a dataset of stocks to allocate capital into different asset
classes.

The dataset used for this case study is Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index and
its respective 30 stocks from year 2000 onwards. The dataset can be downloaded from
yahoo finance.


__Conclusion__

In terms of the intuition behind the eigen portfolios, we demonstrated that the first
eigen portfolio represents a systematic risk factor and other eigen portfolio may represent sector or industry factor. We discuss diversification benefits offered by the eigen
portfolios as they are derived using PCA and are independent.


Looking at the backtesting result, the portfolio with the best result in the training set
leads to the best result in the test set. By using PCA, we get independent eigen portfo‚Äê
lios with higher return and sharp ratio as compared to market.
